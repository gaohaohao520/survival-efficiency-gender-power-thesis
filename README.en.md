## Abstract
This paper addresses the increasingly intense gender conflict in contemporary cyberspace, whose core emotional root is the misunderstanding that "patriarchy is the original sin of the male group's deliberate oppression of women". Starting from the underlying logic of species competition (IQ dominance), through archaeological evidence, physical anthropology data, and objective derivation of the evolution of production modes, a complete logical closed loop of *IQ Dominance → Matrilineal Adaptation → Patrilineal Transfer → Post-Patriarchal Return* is completed. It is proved that the origin of patrilineal power is not the "deliberate oppression" of the male group, but a collective choice made by human groups based on "survival efficiency first" under survival pressure; the contemporary gender conflict emotion is essentially a cognitive deviation from the origin of patrilineal power, and the logical derivation of this paper will provide an objective cognitive basis for resolving the current conflict.

## 1. Underlying Consensus: The Core Logic of Human Dominance on Earth – IQ's Dimension Reduction Strike on Physical Strength
To understand the gender power distribution within humans, we must first establish the underlying consensus at the species competition level: **Humans have become the dominant species on Earth not due to physical advantages, but because IQ (tool creation, language collaboration, logical thinking) has delivered a dimension reduction strike on physical strength**.

1. **Verification of Physical Disadvantages in Species**
   > Refer to data from [authoritative physical anthropology research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_anthropology): The average grip strength of adult males is about 50kg, while the bite force of wild tigers can reach 450kg; the human 100-meter running speed is about 10 seconds, far lower than the cheetah's 120km/h. Humans would have no survival advantage if competing with other species solely by physical strength.

2. **Evidence of IQ's Dimension Reduction Strike**
   Humans have broken through the physical ceiling through IQ:
   - **Tool Creation**: Humans in the Paleolithic Age could make stone spears and axes to compensate for physical inadequacies – archaeological findings at Neanderthal sites dating back 200,000 years show that the success rate of hunting with stone spears was **30%**, far higher than the **1%** success rate of hand-to-hand hunting;
   - **Language Collaboration**: Complex symbols and language enable group division of labor. For example, traces of collective hunting of large mammoths have been found at Homo sapiens sites dating back 100,000 years, and the core of this collaboration is IQ-led communication, not physical superposition;
   - **Experience Inheritance**: Murals and symbols realize intergenerational knowledge transmission. For example, the [murals in the Lascaux Caves in France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lascaux), record hunting routes and animal habits, allowing future generations to avoid re-exploring survival skills and achieve iterative upgrading of capabilities.

3. **Establishment of Underlying Logic**
   All human social forms and power distributions are built on the underlying logic of "IQ dominating survival" – physical strength only exists as an "auxiliary variable" of IQ, not the core basis for power distribution. This is the fundamental premise for the subsequent derivation of gender power distribution.

## 2. Matrilineal Society: Natural Selection of Tool Adaptation and Survival Efficiency – The Initial Form of Power
The formation of matrilineal society was not "women deliberately seizing power", but the natural adaptation of tools to the average capabilities of women, which is the first result of the "survival efficiency first" logic.

1. **Survival Foundation of Matrilineal Society**
   > From the Paleolithic Age to the early Neolithic Age, the core food source of humans was gathering (accounting for **70%-80%** of the total food), and hunting was only a supplement. The core demand of gathering is "accurate identification of edible plants and dexterous operation of small tools", not a lot of physical strength.

2. **Evidence of Gender Adaptation of Tools**
   Archaeological findings of tools from this period are fully adapted to the average capabilities of women:
   - In female tombs of the [Xinglongwa Culture](http://www.kaogu.cn/en/kaogudata/2014/0718/47466.html) (8000 years ago) in China, unearthed stone knives, bone needles and other tools weigh only 10-20g, requiring finger dexterity rather than arm strength. Physical anthropology data shows that women's fine finger movement ability was **12%** higher than men's during this period;
   - In female sites of the European Paleolithic Age, the use traces of plant gathering tools are completely matched with women's bone wear characteristics (more obvious finger bone wear), proving that women were the core participants in gathering.

3. **Natural Formation of Matrilineal Power**
   Since women were the core food producers, and childbirth was the only clear clue to clan blood inheritance (the primitive blood logic of "knowing the mother but not the father"), the resource allocation and affair decision-making of the clan naturally revolved around women – the "matrilineal power" at this time was the efficiency result of "who can make the clan survive", not women's deliberate seizure of power, nor was there a logic of "oppressing men".

## 3. Transfer of Patrilineal Power: Efficiency Choice of Production Mode Iteration and Physical Assistance – Non-Deliberate Power Change
The formation of patrilineal society is the natural result of tool iteration caused by changes in production modes and adaptation to the average physical strength of men, **by no means the deliberate oppression of the male group**, which is the core logic to resolve contemporary conflicts.

1. **Compulsion of Survival Demand**
   In the middle Neolithic Age, the human population increased from 0.1 people per square kilometer in the Paleolithic Age to 1-2 people per square kilometer. The food from gathering could no longer meet the survival needs of the clan, so it was necessary to switch to farming and animal husbandry production modes – the core demand changed from "enough to eat" to "must produce more food".

2. **Efficiency Orientation of Tool Iteration**
   The core tools of farming and animal husbandry (wooden plows, heavy bows, animal husbandry ropes) require "sustained pulling force and explosive force", rather than the dexterity required by gathering tools:
   - In the [Yangshao Culture](http://www.kaogu.cn/en/kaogudata/2014/0718/47466.html) site (6000 years ago) found in archaeology, the wooden plow weighs about 5kg, and the sustained pulling force required to pull the plow is about 30kg. Physical anthropology data shows that men's average arm strength was **20%** higher than women's during this period, making them more efficient in using wooden plows – the reclaimed wasteland area was **2.7 times** that of women using wooden plows;
   - The work of driving and transporting livestock in animal husbandry, men's average physical strength can also bring higher efficiency. For example, in male tombs of the Yangshao Culture, the use traces of animal husbandry ropes are matched with men's bone wear characteristics (more obvious humerus wear).

3. **Natural Transfer of Power**
   Since the average physical strength of men allows them to use farming and animal husbandry tools more efficiently and bring more survival resources (grain, livestock) to the clan, the clan's resource allocation power and affair decision-making power naturally transferred to men – the clan at this time had no concept of "gender oppression", and the core of all choices was "to survive": if women's average physical strength could better adapt to wooden plows and heavy bows at that time, tools would also iterate to adapt to women, and power would remain in women's hands.

4. **Key Evidence of Non-Deliberation**
   Archaeological data of tombs in the Yangshao Culture shows that the gap between male and female burial objects in this period was only **15%** (males had more plows and bows, females had more spinning wheels and pottery), and there was no deliberate deprivation of power; at the same time, the total amount of burial objects for men and women in collective clan tombs was basically equal, proving that power distribution at that time was based on production efficiency, not gender targeting.

## 4. Cognitive Misunderstanding of Contemporary Gender Conflict – Confusing "Non-Deliberate Origin" with "Acquired Solidification of System"
The core emotion of contemporary gender conflict stems from confusing the "origin logic of patrilineal power" with the "acquired solidification of patriarchal system":
1. **Origin of patrilineal power**: It is a natural choice of survival efficiency, with no deliberate oppressors or malice towards any gender;
2. **Acquired solidification of patriarchal system**: It is a post-construction of history and culture – with the stability of the clan, patrilineal power was solidified by ethics, laws and other systems. For example, the ancient Chinese ethics of "men are superior to women" was the later strengthening of patrilineal power, not the cause of its origin.

This confusion leads many people to attribute "later institutional oppression" to the "original sin of the male group", triggering emotional confrontation. In fact, the origin of patrilineal power has nothing to do with "malicious oppression", but is only the result of survival logic.

## 5. Return of Logical Closed Loop: IQ Dominance in the Post-Patriarchal Era – Rebalancing of Gender Power
When the production mode enters the industrial and information age, the auxiliary role of physical strength is completely replaced by machinery and artificial intelligence. Human core competitiveness returns to IQ (technological innovation, creative ability, logical thinking), and the gender power distribution at this time returns to the underlying logic of "IQ dominance":

1. **Elimination of the Role of Physical Strength**
   > Refer to [2025 Public Data from UNESCO](https://en.unesco.org/): The global participation rate of women in scientific research has reached **38%**, with a gap of only **14%** compared with men, and their proportion in language and creative fields has exceeded that of men.

2. **Return of IQ Dominance**
   The core competitiveness of modern society is IQ, and the individual differences between men and women in the core dimensions of IQ (logic, creativity, learning ability) are far greater than gender differences. For example, Katalin Karikó (female), the winner of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, whose breakthrough in mRNA technology is corely driven by IQ-led technological innovation, has nothing to do with physical strength.

3. **Basis for Resolving Conflicts**
   When we understand that the origin of patrilineal power is a natural choice of survival efficiency rather than deliberate oppression by men, the emotional basis of contemporary gender conflict is lost – all gender power distribution is essentially "who can adapt to the current production efficiency", and the core of modern production efficiency is IQ. Both men and women have equal opportunities, so confrontation is unnecessary.
